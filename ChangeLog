	* fixed prototype for gethostbyaddr_r on GNU_NSS

	* fixed ldap-ethers.c to use struct ether
	* fixed bracing in ldap-hosts.c (?)
	* added SSLEAY patch to ldap-nss.h
	* fixed locking in ldap-nss.h
	* Makefile changes incorporated into Makefile.linux

2.30	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* synced into DevMan repository again
	* RFC 2307 is the one!

2.29e	Luke Howard <lhoward@apple.com>

	* util.c: fixed memory leak (call to ldap_value_free())

2.29d	Luke Howard <lhoward@apple.com>

	* ldap-ethers.c: fixed to use HOSTNAME attribute

2.29c	Luke Howard <lhoward@apple.com>

	* ieee8022Device -> ieee802Device

2.29b	Luke Howard <lhoward@apple.com>

	* added ieee8022Device and bootableDevice classes,
	  at Sun's request.

2.29a	Luke Howard <lhoward@apple.com>

	* dc -> cn

2.29	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* changed host/network/ethers naming schema
	  see the -02 draft revision for more info

2.28	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* ldap-pwd.c, ldap-spwd.c: fixed tmpbuf stuff. Yuck.

2.27	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* ANNOUNCE: reflected draft-howard-nis-schema-01.txt
	* ldap-spwd.c: default for shadow integer values is -1, not 0
	  and fixed crasher (thanks to dj@gregor.com)

2.26	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* globals.c: added offset stuff back for mapping errnumbers.
	  Weird: this stuff *was* in an earlier version of the work
	  area. I have no idea where it went. Scary.

2.25	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* irs-nss.h: added prototype for irs_ldap_acc()
	* ldap-*.[ch]: removed redundent PARSER macro
	* unbroke for GNU NSS (context_key_t changed to context_handle_t)

2.24	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* irs-nss.c: added dispatch table for IRS library
	* testpw5.c: added additional test program
	* ldap-nss.c: removed spurious debug statement
	* ldap-nss.c, util.c, dnsconfig.c: cleaned up memory
	  allocation for config. (This could be improved, but
	  there is no longer a static ldap_config_t structure.)
	* Makefile: general cleanup

2.23	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* default destructor is now simply wrapped around by individual backend
	  destructors
	* __EXTENSIONS__ defined for Solaris 2.6 to import strncasecmp()
	* getbyname: fixed crasher in ldap-nss.c due to uninitialized variable
	* ldap-parse.h, assorted others: tidied up resolver calls to use
	  NSS_ARGS() macro and not to interfere with the previous backend's
	  status (bad thing!)
	* ldap-service.c: cleaned up potential uninitialized var in parser
	* ldap-nss.c: no valued arrays are now { NULL } instead of NULL.

2.22	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* testpw.c: XXX problem. dies with segfault, but gdb doesn't give
	  me enough information; it's definitely within nss_ldap.so though.
	  I just can't see the symbols. (Maybe dbx would be better...)
	  However, testpw doesn't work at *all* under 2.5.1, and technically
	  it shouldn't as it's not linked against liblthread. I haven't been
	  able to duplicate this with testpw2, which is the same code linked
	  with the thread library.
	* backported to NeXT

2.21	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* resolve.h: renamed functions so as to keep namespace clean
	* snprintf.h: tidied up for systems which already have snprintf()
	  and renamed anyway to keep namespace clean (_nss_ldap_snprintf)
	* ldap-*.h: made character constants const to avoid nasty warnings
	* globals.[ch]: as above
	* README, TODO, ANNOUNCE: general documentation updates
	* ldap-nss.c, et al: general work on Solaris 2.6 port, to get
	  nscd working. Lots of fiddling with the locking.
	* Major architectural changes to Solaris NSS implementation.
	  Thread specific data is now stored in the backend, where it
	  should be: just like it is in IRS. Locking is a little more
	  coarse now, but it will do for the moment.
	* Paul Henson's DCE module gave me the inspiration to do the
	  backend stuff the "right" way -- thanks, Paul!
	* As a result, a lot of the bugs listed in TODO have mysteriously
	  fixed themselves. :-)

2.20	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* Makefile.*: ensured resolve.[ch] and dnsconfig.[ch] were there.
	* Makefile: should link now with gcc -shared instead of requiring
	  cc.

2.19	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* testpw4.c: added irs hostbyname() test
	* Makefile: added correct flags to build position indepdenent
	  code with Sun's compiler (thanks, Bill). Added SRV sources.
	* testpw.c: works under NeXT, cleaned up a bit.
	* ldap.conf: documented what this file does
	* util.c: ignore blank lines in ldap.conf properly
	* resolve.h: fixed up for Solaris

2.18	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* ldap-network.c: fixed infinite loop in getnetbyname()
	* util.c: goto out causes a compiler warning under Solaris.
	  Documented this. Should fix this, I suppose, but we need
	  to break out of two blocks. (We could remove the code that
	  handles multivalued DNs, as it's fairly unlikely that someone
	  will use a DN of o=Xedoc+dc=xedoc,c=US+dc=com, but who knows?)
	* ldap-ethers.c: line 215, result was not assigned to an
	  lvalue (should have been args->status, not args). Fixed.

2.17	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* Cleaned up documentation and testpw4.c
	* dnsconfig.c: Fixed strtok() bug which was clobbering domain

2.16	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* util.c (_nss_ldap_readconfig) fixed strtok() typo

2.15	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* dnsconfig.c: got DNS SRV support working under NEXTSTEP 
	* util.c: (_nss_ldap_getdomainname) made host and network DN parsing
          compliant with current draft 

2.2 - 2.14	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* I'll get around to merging in the RCS log here one day.
	  Nothing very exciting happened, I just backported the code to
	  NEXTSTEP and compiled it.

2.1 	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* merged in old RCS tree (now nss_ldap 0.2)

1.x	Luke Howard <lukeh@xedoc.com>

	* old RCS repository (corresponds to nss_ldap 0.1)
