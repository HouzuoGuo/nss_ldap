Ooops.  I forgot to check in the man page for irs.conf(5).  Here's one:

IRS.CONF(5)                 BSD Programmer's Manual                IRS.CONF(5)

NAME
     irs.conf - Information Retrieval System configuration file

SYNOPSIS
     irs.conf

DESCRIPTION
     The irs(3) functions are a set of routines in the C library which provide
     access to various system maps.  The maps that irs currently controls are
     the following: passwd, group, services, protocols, hosts, networks and
     netgroup.  When a program first calls a function that accesses one of
     these maps, the irs configuration file is read, and the source of each
     map is determined for the life of the process.

     If this file does not exist, the irs routines default to using local
     sources for all information, with the exception of the host and networks
     maps, which use the Domain Name System (DNS).

     Each record in the file consists of one line.  A record consists of a
     map-name, an access-method and possibly a (comma delimited) set of op-
     tions, separated by tabs or spaces.  Blank lines, and text between a #
     and a newline are ignored.

     Available maps:

           Map name        Information in map
           =========       ==================================
           passwd          User authentication information
           group           User group membership information
           services        Network services directory
           protocols       Network protocols directory
           hosts           Network hosts directory
           networks        Network "network names" directory
           netgroup        Network "host groups" directory

     Available access methods:

           Access method   Description
           =============   =================================================
           local           Use a local file, usually in /etc
           dns             Use the domain name service (includes hesiod)
           nis             Use the Sun-compatible Network Information Service
>>         ldap            Use the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

     Available options:

           Option          Description
           ========        ================================================
           continue        don't stop searching if you can't find something
           merge           don't stop searching if you CAN find something

     The continue option creates ``union namespaces'' whereby subsequent ac-
     cess methods of the same map type can be tried if a name cannot be found
     using earlier access methods.  This can be quite confusing in the case of
     host names, since the name to address and address to name mappings can be
     visibly asymmetric even though the data used by any given access method
     is entirely consistent.  This behavior is, therefore, not the default.

     The merge option only affects lookups in the groups map.  If set, subse-
     quent access methods will be tried in order to cause local users to ap-
     pear in NIS (or other remote) groups in addition to the local groups.

EXAMPLE
           # Get password entries from local file, or failing that, NIS
           passwd          local   continue
           passwd          nis

           # Build group membership from both local file, and NIS.
           group           local   continue,merge
           group           nis

           # Services comes from just the local file.
           services        local

           protocols       local

           # Hosts comes first from DNS, failing that, the local file
           hosts           dns     continue
           hosts           local

           networks        local

           netgroup        local

NOTES
     If a local user needs to be in the local host's ``wheel'' group but not
     in every host's ``wheel'' group, put them in the local host's /etc/group
     ``wheel'' entry and set up the ``groups'' portion of your /etc/irs.conf
     file as:

           group   local   continue,merge
           group   nis

     The dns access method is only supported for the ``hosts'' and
     ``networks'' maps.  The other maps fall under the control of Hesiod, and
     have not been well tested.

     NIS takes a long time to time out.  Especially for hosts if you use the
     -d option to your server's ``ypserv'' daemon.

     It is important that the irs.conf file contain an entry for each map.  If
     a map is not mentioned in the irs.conf file, all queries to that map will
     fail.

FILES
     /etc/irs.conf      The file irs.conf resides in /etc.
