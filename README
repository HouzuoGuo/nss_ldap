LDAP NAMESERVICE SWITCH LIBRARY
===============================

This is the nss_ldap library, an LDAP module for the Solaris Nameservice
Switch (NSS). This should be compatible with the GNU glibc if GNU_NSS is
defined, and the ISC BIND IRS if IRS_NSS is defined.

****************************IMPORTANT NOTE *********************************
Versions 2.55 and above of the nss_ldap library are designed to work with
glibc 2.1, not glibc 2.0. They _may_ work with glibc 2.0. YMMV.
****************************************************************************

The LDAP schema used is described in RFC 2307

Insert this:

passwd:     files nis ldap
group:      files nis ldap

or something similar in /etc/nsswitch.conf.

The source code is distributed under the GNU General Library Public Licence
(see COPYING.LIB). 

Platforms this has been built under:

	o Linux 2.0 (tested by Greg and Luke)
	o Solaris 2.4 and 2.6 (tested by Luke) It should work under
	  Solaris 7 as the NSS ABI hasn't changed according to Sun.
	o NEXTSTEP 4.2 (part tested; does it matter?)

Platforms this ought to be tested under:

	o Solaris 2.5.x
	o BSD/OS (requires BIND IRS source)
	o FreeBSD (requires BIND IRS source)

To install, pick a makefile and type make. You'll need to fiddle around
a bit...

You need to ensure libnss_ldap.so.1 (or nss_ldap.so.1, for Solaris) is in
/usr/lib.

Under IRIX, you'll need to set _RLD_LIST to

	libnss_ldap.so:libldap.so:DEFAULT

IRIX 6.5 has native LDAP support in nsd so you don't need this.

You can build a position independent LDAP client library by compiling
-fPIC and linking with -shared, or downloading the Mozilla or Netscape
LDAP SDKs. Note that OpenLDAP only appears to build shared libraries
on some platforms (apparently not Solaris).

NOTE: There seem to be problems linking against the libraries included
with Netscape's Directory Server 4.1. You may wish to try Netscape's
LDAP SDK 3.0 instead.

If ldap-nss.c doesn't link because ldap_ld_free() isn't defined (or
the module fails at runtime with a "relocation error: symbol 
ldap_ld_free: referenced symbol not found", then undefine 
HAVE_LDAP_LD_FREE at the top of ldap-nss.c. This is exported on
Linux but _NOT_ Solaris with Netscape's C SDK.
