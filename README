LDAP NAMESERVICE SWITCH LIBRARY
===============================

This is version 0.1 of nss_ldap, an LDAP module for the Solaris Nameservice
Switch (NSS). This should be compatible with the GNU glibc if GNU_NSS is
defined, and the ISC BIND IRS if IRS_NSS is defined.

The LDAP schema used is described in draft-ietf-asid-nis-schema-01.txt.

Insert this:

passwd:     files nis ldap
group:      files nis ldap

or something similar to /etc/nsswitch.conf.

The source code is distributed under the GNU General Library Public Licence
(see COPYING.LIB). Neither authors' employers are affiliated with this project.

Platforms this has been tested under:

	o Linux 2.0
	o Solaris 2.4

Platforms this ought to be tested under:

	o Solaris 2.[56]
	o BSD/OS
	o FreeBSD

To install, type

	$ Configure
	$ make

You want to ensure libnss_ldap.so.1 (or nss_ldap.so.1, for Solaris) is in
/usr/lib. Under IRIX, you'll need to set _RLD_LIST to

	libnss_ldap.so:libldap.so:DEFAULT

(Netscape's SDK has libldap.so if you don't want to build your own.)
