LDAP NAMESERVICE SWITCH LIBRARY
===============================

This is version 0.2 of nss_ldap, an LDAP module for the Solaris Nameservice
Switch (NSS). This should be compatible with the GNU glibc if GNU_NSS is
defined, and the ISC BIND IRS if IRS_NSS is defined.

The LDAP schema used is described in RFC 2307

Insert this:

passwd:     files nis ldap
group:      files nis ldap

or something similar in /etc/nsswitch.conf.

The source code is distributed under the GNU General Library Public Licence
(see COPYING.LIB). 

Platforms this has been built under:

	o Linux 2.0 (tested by Greg and Luke)
	o Solaris 2.4 and 2.6 (tested by Luke) It should work under
	  Solaris 7 as the NSS ABI hasn't changed according to Sun.
	o NEXTSTEP 4.2 (part tested; does it matter?)

Platforms this ought to be tested under:

	o Solaris 2.5.x
	o BSD/OS
	o FreeBSD

To install, pick a makefile and type make. You'll need to fiddle around
a bit...

You need to ensure libnss_ldap.so.1 (or nss_ldap.so.1, for Solaris) is in
/usr/lib.

Under IRIX, you'll need to set _RLD_LIST to

	libnss_ldap.so:libldap.so:DEFAULT

IRIX 6.5 has native LDAP support in nsd so you don't need this.

You can build a position independent LDAP client library by compiling
-fPIC and linking with -shared, or downloading the Mozilla or Netscape
LDAP SDKs.
