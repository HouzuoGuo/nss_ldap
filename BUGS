BUGZILLA BUGS:
==============

[BUG#12]
- we should probably put the session, under Solaris, in the backend. 
  We need to do so in a way that remains compatible with the GNU NSS,
  where I expect we need to open a connection for every lookup.
  In nscd, where the backends are cached, it doesn't make sense to keep
  opening and closing sockets to the LDAP server, particularly as the
  rebinding logic was put there to *allow* the connection to be long
  lived.

[BUG#12]
- ditto for IRS: the private data should contain the session and be long
  lived. 

[BUG#13]
- we could clean up the text segment a bit by generating filters on the
  fly from object classes and attributes, instead of storing them. This
  seems to be important under Solaris as the linker doesn't intern strings (?)
  All that filter-constructing stuff in the ldap-*.h headers is UGLY.

[BUG#14]
- infinite recursion is host lookup -- libldap uses gethostbyname(). Perhaps
  we should link with a custom gethostbyname() which uses DNS only??? (This
  is nominally the LDAP client library's problem but we could short-circuit
  by resolving the IP addresses ourselves).

[BUG#16]
- finish implementing dl-*.c  (LOW priority). In fact I'm tempted to remove
  this from the line up: SGI have their own LDAP C library support, and
  so do DEC (with SIA).

[BUG#17]
- implement gethostbyname2() and
  debug IPv6 support in ldap-hosts.c (and ldap-network.c?) (Uli?)

[BUG#18]
- write ldap-netgrp.c and irs-netgrp.c (Uli, +Luke IRS)
  This is a lot easier now that the schema supports triples:

  squid> ldapsearch -L objectclass=nisnetgroup
  dn: cn=nightfly, o=Xedoc Software Development, c=AU
  cn: nightfly
  ttl: 86400
  objectclass: nisNetgroup
  objectclass: cacheObject
  objectclass: top
  membernisnetgroup: kamakiriad
  membernisnetgroup: ruby-baby
  nisnetgrouptriple: (lukeh,penguin,yp.padl.com)
  nisnetgrouptriple: (fagen,grep.next.com,yp.padl.com)

  You should be able to (a) rip out the flat file parser under Solaris -- the semantics
  are complicated, which is why I haven't done it (!), but basically you get a function
  pointer which will parse a flatfile entry into whatever struct and (b) use the glibc
  NIS code for the glibc part of the NSS. Or use (b) for both. It's up to you, but the
  netgroup structs will be different...

[BUG#19]
- add support for DHCP and coldstart configuration. Coldstart should
  update /etc/ldap.conf (/var/ldap/LDAP_CLIENT_CACHE?).

[BUG#20]
- use asynchronous search API

[BUG#21]
- write testsuite. 

[BUG#22]
- support for bootparams map

[BUG#34]
- shells hang on Solaris for LDAP users
